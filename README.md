Blinkered Gradient Boosted Machine
==================================

--- CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE ::: WORK IN PROGRESS ----

This project contains a set of experiments that will be used to test some variations of the GBM algorithm

### Experiment One

Take a set of difficult regression tasks and evaluate a set of standard models built using default parameters.

Each R script runs the experiment for a specific dataset.

[RUN_EXPERIMENT_1.R](RUN_EXPERIMENT_1.R)


### Experiment Two

Repeat experiment one using a grid search procedure over common meta-parameters


### Experiment Three

Perform an experiment on the full versions of several large data sets on a distributed file system using H2O in distributed mode
